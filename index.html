            <h2>Course Development</h2>
            <p>
              As an Azure Administrator, one of my key projects involved course development within Azure platforms. This encompassed creating and curating educational content tailored to specific learning objectives and target audiences. I collaborated with subject matter experts to ensure accuracy and relevance of the course material. Additionally, I utilized Azure's resources and tools to enhance the learning experience, such as Azure DevOps for project management and Azure Virtual Machines for hands-on labs. Throughout the course development process, I focused on promoting engagement, clarity, and accessibility to empower learners to effectively leverage Azure technologies.
            </p>

            <h2>Inviting Guests and Members on Azure Entra</h2>
            <p>
              Within the scope of Azure administration, I managed user access and permissions on Azure Entra, Microsoft's collaborative platform for teams. One of my responsibilities involved inviting guests and members to join Entra workspaces and projects. This required a thorough understanding of Azure Entra's user management capabilities and security features. I ensured that invited users were granted appropriate access levels based on their roles and responsibilities within the organization. By facilitating seamless collaboration and communication through Azure Entra, I contributed to the efficiency and productivity of cross-functional teams.
            </p>

            <h2>Resetting Passwords on Entra</h2>
            <p>
              Another aspect of my role as an Azure Administrator was assisting users with password-related issues on Azure Entra. This involved troubleshooting login problems, verifying user identities, and guiding individuals through the password reset process. I leveraged Azure's identity management tools to securely authenticate users and enforce password policies. Additionally, I provided user education and support to promote best practices for password security and authentication. By promptly addressing password reset requests, I ensured uninterrupted access to Azure Entra resources and maintained the integrity of user accounts.
